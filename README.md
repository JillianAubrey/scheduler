# Interview Scheduler
Interview scheduler is a single page app created with React. It allows users to create, edit and delete interview slots.

This project was completed as a part of my learning at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/). The purpose of this project was to learn how to work with React.
